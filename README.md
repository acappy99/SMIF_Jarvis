# SMIF_Jarvis

SMIF_Jarvis is an automation project for my graduate assistanship at West Virginia University. I am responsible for the oversight and cash management of a student managed endowment fund (SMIF). Many of my tasks are repetitous and I hope to develop this project to create more time at work for more important tasks and learn more hands-on Python development.

As I am still learning, my knowledge of python environments is minimal, so earlier stage drafts of the modules will be developed and tested in Jupyter notebook. However, I will quickly pivot to using a more scalable and felxible enviornment.

### End Goal

- Automate data aggregation from the SMIF's broker through a script that reads a regular email and stores the attahed data file
- Perform data manipulation, calculate key portfolio statistics, and save records
- Produce a daily report with biggest gainer/losers, portfolio metrics, and AUM data
- Produce and distribute the daily report via email to student analysts and the portfolio director
