# SMIF_Jarvis

SMIF_Jarvis is an automation project for my graduate assistanship for a University's student managed investment fund (SMIF). I am responsible for general oversight and monitoring of the endowment and student analysts. Many of my tasks are repetitous and I hope to develop this project to create more time at work for more important tasks while learning Python development hands-on.

### End Goal

- Automate data aggregation from the SMIF's broker through a script that reads a regular email and stores the attahed data file
- Perform data manipulation, calculate key portfolio statistics, and save records
- Produce a daily report with biggest gainer/losers, portfolio metrics, and AUM data
- Produce and distribute the daily report via email to student analysts and the portfolio director
