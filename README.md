# SMIF_Jarvis

SMIF_Jarvis is an automation project for my graduate assistanship at West Virginia University. I am responsible for the oversight and cash management of a student managed endowment fund (SMIF). Many of my tasks are repetitous and I hope to develop this project to create more time at work for more important tasks and learn more hands-on Python development.

As I am still learning, my knowledge of python environments is minimal, so earlier stage drafts of the modules will be developed and tested in Jupyter notebook. However, I will quickly pivot to using a more scalable and felxible enviornment.
